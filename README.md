# “Code & Compute: A Simple Yet Brilliant Python Calculator”

This project is a simple yet functional Python-based calculator designed to perform essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was created to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and writing clean, logical code.

Even though it’s a beginner-friendly project, it taught me how to structure a program, handle user input, manage errors, and build a tool that actually works for real users.

3. Project Objective

The goal of this project was to:

understand and implement basic Python concepts

convert logic into working code

create a small real-world tool

practice handling user inputs and errors

build my first step toward larger Python applications

4. Features of the Calculator

Here’s what the calculator can do:

✔ Performs basic arithmetic operations

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

✔ Accurate and fast calculations

The program takes input from the user, processes it instantly, and returns results without delay.

✔ Simple and user-friendly interface

Clear instructions guide the user through the process so anyone can use it easily.
